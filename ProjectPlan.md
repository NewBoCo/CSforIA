## Our project plan document is as follows. We have photos of our site sketches and wireframes on github within the images folder for the project.

## The project plan document should contain the following information:

   # CS4Iowa4Life
   ## Taylor Robinson
   ## Nathan Cashman
   ## Ben Van Meter
   ## Craig Barkley

   # Project Name: CS4 Iowa and Concept: Provide a dynamic site that offers insight into Computer Science programs in Iowa School Districts K - 12.

   ## Home page Map.
   ###### We would like to present some generalized data, a chart or two, in conjunction with an image map displaying state data. Also show on the homepage showing who has and who has not submitted the code.org. Also display what percentage of the ones who have responded the teach and do not teach computer science classes. Use local storage to persevere user experience. 

   ## District Data Page.
   ###### We would like to present more specific data. We would show chart for who has responded and what percentage of CS do they teach throughout there district and who has the highest percentages. We can show, a sort filter to show the top district schools who have submitted and are teaching CS from 100% down to zero. Use local storage to persevere user experience. Represent district data, number of students, number of districts.



   ## Sketches/wireframes of your project's pages.
