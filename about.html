      Hey there. I'm Ben Van Meter.
    </p> 
    <p>
        For the past 17 years I've been in the graphic design profession, mainly on the publishing side of things. With that said, as
        the desire to do design work on paper products have become extinct (or outsourced). Therefore, I thought what better way to bulk up
        my graphic design experience with coding experience. With zero prior knowledge of coding, I decided to dive into the realm of coding
        through the DeltaV code course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Responsibilities for this project: Work side-by-side with Craig to strengthen my Javascript skills; create CSS elements that would
        be consistently used across all pages (the header information and footer information) and set up CSS elements for the index page. I was
        also an source of design and color information/suggestions that helped out the rest of the team in regard of giving the site a visual appeal.

        <p>My name is Taylor Robinson and I'm currently a student at the DeltaV Code School. I started this class because computers have been a big part of my life and I wanted to pursue a career in web development. I am very proficient when it comes to using computers, but before this class I had very little experience with writing code and building web pages. I've had a great experience working on this web page because younger minds in Iowa should be shown that coding and web development are very viable career paths. The ultimate goal is to increase exposure, as well as the amount of schools that offer Computer Science classes. Computer Science is a big part of the future and it's our hopes to get Iowa fully on board. </p>

    <p>With a Management Information Systems Degree, I have worked with medium retail businesses 
      for the last 15 years and enjoy using my knowledge to create value for those companies. I am currently
       a DeltaV student, as well as a Kirkwood Community College student finishing a Computer Software Development
        and Web Technologies Associate in Applied Science. I am effective at learning and integrating those new technology 
        skills into my development process. I am hoping to find a role creating world class business applications for small
         to medium size businesses. As a small business owner I know the importance of having a strategic business plan that
          includes a technology as a main component to their success; and I want to share my management skills and experiences
           with them to help them overcome the boundaries that all businesses face in the global market.. </p>

        <p>Nathan Cashman - An ex-music educator with a bachelor's degree from Drake University. After choosing to leave 
          the field of education, he decided to follow an interest in technology he's had since a young age. 
          His interest in the field was inspired by the numerous innovations that constantly emerge from the 
          field of technology and he decided he'd like to be a part of that. Through his past experiences in 
          education and music, he is proficient in higher-level thinking and professional communication and 
          he has developed a strong work ethic and sense of self-motivation. In his current field, he is well 
          rounded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and adept at thinking through a given problem and figuring 
          out the most effective way to solve it. His goal is simply to find a role in an industry where he can 
          make use of his love of learning. </p> 
        <p>Responsibilities on this project: Data filtering and storage functionality, data styling, debugging, 
          stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld, meme master. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6EoRBvdVPQ&list=PLlNF4RHbrRE11VDW3StUcOkvDToMR1F92'><img class='smug' src='images/DANGERKEEPOUTTHATMEANSYOUKEITH/projectmeme.png'></a>
