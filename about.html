    <img  src="images/Ben 2.png" >  
    <p>With a Management Information Systems Degree, I have worked with medium retail businesses 
        for the last 15 years and enjoy using my knowledge to create value for those companies. I am currently
         a DeltaV student, as well as a Kirkwood Community College student finishing a Computer Software Development
          and Web Technologies Associate in Applied Science. I am effective at learning and integrating those new technology 
          skills into my development process. I am hoping to find a role creating world class business applications for small
           to medium size businesses. As a small business owner I know the importance of having a strategic business plan that
            includes a technology as a main component to their success; and I want to share my management skills and experiences
             with them to help them overcome the boundaries that all businesses face in the global market.. </p>
