    <p>With a Management Information Systems Degree, I have worked with medium retail businesses 
        for the last 15 years and enjoy using my knowledge to create value for those companies. I am currently
         a DeltaV student, as well as a Kirkwood Community College student finishing a Computer Software Development
          and Web Technologies Associate in Applied Science. I am effective at learning and integrating those new technology 
          skills into my development process. I am hoping to find a role creating world class business applications for small
           to medium size businesses. As a small business owner I know the importance of having a strategic business plan that
            includes a technology as a main component to their success; and I want to share my management skills and experiences
             with them to help them overcome the boundaries that all businesses face in the global market.. </p>

        <p>I'm an ex-music educator with a bachelor's degree from Drake University. After choosing to leave 
          the field of education, I decided to follow an interest in technology I've had since a young age. 
          My interest in the field was inspired by the numerous innovations that constantly emerge from the 
          field of technology and I decided I'd like to be a part of that. Through my past experiences in 
          education and music, I am proficient in higher-level thinking and professional communication and 
          I have developed a strong work ethic and sense of self-motivation. In my current field, I am well 
          rounded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I am adept at thinking through a given problem and figuring 
          out the most effective way to solve it. My goal is simply to find a role in an industry where I can 
          make use of my love of learning. </p> 
        <p>Responsibilities on this project: Data filtering and storage functionality, data styling, debugging, 
          stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld, meme master. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'><img class='smug' src='images/DANGERKEEPOUTTHATMEANSYOUKEITH/projectmeme.png'></a>
