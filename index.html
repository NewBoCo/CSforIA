      <p>We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Every time you practice, you learn more. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. 
        Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Let the paint work. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.
        Very easy to work these to death. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. This painting comes right out of your heart. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.
        You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Do an almighty painting with us.
        Learn when to stop. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.</p>
