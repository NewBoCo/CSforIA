#Group agreement

###Now that you've had a chance to talk some as a group, step away from the project pitch to develop a group agreement. This is a document that your group creates collaboratively; it details your expectations of how you will work with each other. It is a "living document" - that is, it can be changed as you go along to meet your group's needs as they emerge. Again, develop this collaboratively and write it down together on a whiteboard. Keep refining it until everyone in the group agrees with it. At the minimum, it should cover:

#Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety, as we learned about in the article on Google and teams from Class 14?
##We are meeting in person everyday. We are also available on slack, to talk outside of class. 

#Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
##We will discuss with eath other our conficts and try and resolve them amongst ourselves. We can then take a team vote on what direction the development of the issue will be. We have agreed that if one memeber does not feel comfortable with that, they can go directly to Human Resource and request help to resolve the conflict. Keith and Jess are HR. 
   
#Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
##We will be using Git Hub to manage our tasks. And using our pull requests to ensure we are all contributing to the project. We also voiced, that we should ask each other questions about development issues that we as indivduals are not able to resolve.
    
#Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?
##Nathan is our Merge Master, we will all submit on branches our code. Then periodically meet with Nathan to review the merge, then submit and continue.

#Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
##We will be working together each class session and are available to meet outside of class if needed. We take breaks when we need them, as well. We will start the day with the standup meeting to allocate work.
